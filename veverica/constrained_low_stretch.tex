\maketitle

Let $G=(V,E,w)$ be an undirected weighted graph, $X \subset V$ a set of observed
nodes, $\stcomp{X}$ its complement and \allst{} the set of spanning
trees of $G$. We are looking for

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:prob}
	T^* = \argmin_{T \in \mathcal{T}_G} \sum_{i \in X ,\,j \in \stcomp{X}} \left|
		path_T(i, j) \right |
\end{equation}

First note that the way $T\in \allst$ connects nodes in $X$ is irrelevant to
the \objf{}.

Let's first consider the unweighted case ($w=\boldsymbol{1}$) and look at
the figure below, where the nodes of \stcomp{X} are sorted by distance
from $X$ (where $d$ is the shortest path distance in $G$).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{concentric}
\end{center}

All nodes $j$ in the first circle $C_1$ will contribute at least $1$ to the \objf{},
all nodes $j'$ in the second circle $2$ and so on (because by definition, there
is no path shorter than 2 between $j'$ and any node $i \in X$).

Thus a natural idea would be to connect each $j \in C_1$ to one of its parent
in $X$ then merge $C_1$ to $X$ and repeat the process. This is basically akin
to creating a breadth first tree, starting with $X$ as the \enquote{discovered
border}.

The weighted case is more involved, because we cannot sort the nodes so easily.
Yet adding outgoing edges from $X$ while maintaining the tree structure,
\emph{à la} Prim, may do the trick.
