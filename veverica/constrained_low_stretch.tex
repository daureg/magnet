\section*{Problem}

Let $G=(V,E,w)$ be an undirected weighted graph, $X \subset V$ a set of observed
nodes, $\stcomp{X}$ its complement and \allst{} the set of spanning
trees of $G$. We are looking for

\begin{align}
	T^* = \argmin_{T \in \mathcal{T}_G} \; & f(T) \notag \\
	\text{where }\; & f(T) = \sum_{i \in X ,\,j \in \stcomp{X}} \left| path_T(i, j) \right |
	\label{eq:prob}
\end{align}

Note that by symmetry of \eqref{eq:prob}, we may assume that $|X| \leq
\left| \stcomp{X}\right|$. A variant of $f$ is $g$, which measures how closely
a given tree $T$ projects $\stcomp{X}$ onto $X$:
\begin{align}
	g(T)= \sum_{j \in \stcomp{X}} \min_{i \in X} \left| path_T(i, j) \right |
\end{align}
Contrary to $f$, $g$ is not symmetric in $X$ and $\stcomp{X}$: consider for
instance the case where $X$ is a singleton.

\section*{Methods}

Let's first consider the unweighted case: $w=\boldsymbol{1}$. Here are three
ideas on how to solve the problem:
\begin{description}

	\item[Merged $k$-BFTs] The first one is quite natural albeit rather
		unpractical: for each $i \in X$, we build an arbitrary Breadth First
		Tree (BFT) rooted at $i$ (let's call it $T_i$. There are several BFTs
		rooted at $i$ hence we could build $k$ of them. In the following
		experiments though, we set $k=1$). This yields the shortest paths from
		$i$ to all $j \in \stcomp{X}$, and we denote the sum of the lengths of
		these $|\stcomp{X}|$ paths as $S_i$. Therefore a (non tight) lower
		bound of $f(T^*)$ is $\sum_{i\in X} S_i$. The last step is then to
		merge these $|X|$ BFTs into a single spanning tree. Unfortunately I
		couldn't think of a straightforward way to do that. One method would be
		to count by how many BFTs each edges is used, and use the opposite of
		these counts as weights for a minimum spanning tree algorithm, the
		intuition being that we want to preserve edges that are important for
		many nodes in $X$.

	\item[Expanding BFTs] The second is based on the observation that, if $X =
		\{i\}$ is made of a single node, then $T^* = T_i$. Thus if $|X| > 1$,
		we want to extend that property by expanding BFTs simultaneously from
		all $i \in X$. Yet to ensure we get a spanning tree at the end, we need
		to avoid creating cycle. It's motivated by the cycle example presented
		in \autoref{fig:cycle}~\vpageref{fig:cycle}. In that case, this method
		could find $T^*$ since the optimal edge will be among the last to be
		reached and thus cut.

		\begin{figure}[hbp]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{cpcycle.pdf}
			\caption{In a simple cycle, drawing a spanning tree $T_e$ amounts
				to cutting one edge $e$. Here $X$ is in orange and the label of
				each edge $e$ is the cost $f(T_e)$ of the associated tree. The
				optimal edge is between 0 and 17 yet we observe that because of
				the concentration of $X$ nodes around 0, the edge is pushed
				closer to 17. \label{fig:cycle}}
		\end{figure}

		In practice, we maintain a tree rooted at each node of $X$ (line 7).
		We expand them in a Breadth first manner (line 9--20) as long as they
		don't encounter nodes belonging to another tree. When that happened,
		there are two cases. Either these two trees joined previously and there
		is nothing to do (line 16). Otherwise, we add an edge between the two
		tree and we make note that there is now a path between them (connecting
		all the others trees they may have encounter before).  The formal
		description is provided in \autoref{alg:mbfs} \vpageref{alg:mbfs}.

		As said in the caption of \autoref{fig:cycle}, the optimal edge is
		farther from 0, suggesting that larger subtrees (as defined by the
		number of nodes of $X$ they contain) should grow faster ( for instance
		the one starting from $0-1-2$). Taking into account this
		\enquote{\textbf{Momentum}} of each subtree, upon dequeuing a node at
		line 10, we skip it (i.e. enqueue it back) with probability based on
		the ratio of the size of the subtree this node belongs and the size of
		the currently largest subtree. This process favor the growth of subtree
		that contains more $X$ nodes.

	\item[Modified SGT] Although BFTs enjoy alluring practical performances,
		they don't provide any theoretical guarantees. Therefore we might adapt
		\emph{Galaxy Tree} construction to that setting, by choosing star
		centers in priority in $X$. Practically, instead of sorting nodes by
		their degree, we sort them in lexicographical order according to $(1 -
		\mathbbm{1}_X, \textrm{degree})$ (that is we put all nodes of $X$
		first). When collapsing the graph, we need to decide how to propagate
		the information about membership to $X$. The simplest way (currently
		implemented in the experiments) is to say that a star (i.e. a node in
		the future collapsed graph) belongs to $X'$ (the successor of $X$ in
		the new graph) if its center belongs to $X$. A more complicated method
		would replace the binary indicator function by a real value
		representing the strength of the tie with $X$ (for instance, a star
		made only of nodes of $X$ should be more strongly associated to $X'$
		than one with only one node in $X$). It's unclear whether this would
		provide any gain.

\end{description}

In addition, we compare with some baselines that don't rely very much on $X$.

\begin{description}
	\item[BFT] A Breadth First tree rooted at (one of) the node with highest
		degree in $X$.
	\item[SGT] The good old short galaxy tree, completely ignoring $X$.
\end{description}

				\EndIf
			\EndFor
		\EndWhile
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\section*{Preliminary Results}

We test these methods on a toy example in
\autoref{fig:rcycle}~\vpageref{fig:rcycle} (the small cycle of
\autoref{fig:cycle}) and on two small ($n=1024$) graph: preferential
attachment \autoref{fig:rpa}~\vpageref{fig:rpa} and a grid
\autoref{fig:rgrid}~\vpageref{fig:rgrid}. 

On these last two, more realistic examples, we see that the baselines
outperforms all other methods introduced previously, especially the simple
BFT. It also seems that the momentum heuristic improve the solution cost.

What it suggest to me is that it could be easier to start from the baseline BFT
and see how it can be greedily improved based on path length computations.
