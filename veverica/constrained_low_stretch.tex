\section*{Problem}

Let $G=(V,E,w)$ be an undirected weighted graph, $X \subset V$ a set of observed
nodes, $\stcomp{X}$ its complement and \allst{} the set of spanning
trees of $G$. We are looking for

\begin{align}
	T^* = \argmin_{T \in \mathcal{T}_G} \; & f(T) \notag \\
	\text{where }\; & f(T) = \sum_{i \in X ,\,j \in \stcomp{X}} \left| path_T(i, j) \right |
	\label{eq:prob}
\end{align}

Note that by symmetry of \eqref{eq:prob}, we may assume that $|X| \leq
\left| \stcomp{X}\right|$. A variant of $f$ is $g$, which measures how closely
a given tree $T$ project $\stcomp{X}$ onto $X$:
\begin{align}
	g(T)= \sum_{j \in \stcomp{X}} \min_{i \in X} \left| path_T(i, j) \right |
\end{align}
Contrary to $f$, $g$ is not symmetric in $X$ and $\stcomp{X}$: consider for
instance the case were $X$ is a singleton.

\section*{Methods}

Let's first consider the unweighted case: $w=\boldsymbol{1}$. Here are three
ideas on how to solve the problem:
\begin{description}

	\item[Merged $k$-BFTs] The first one is quite natural albeit rather
		unpractical: for each $i \in X$, we build an arbitrary Breadth First
		Tree (BFT) rooted at $i$ (let's call it $T_i$. There are several BFTs
		rooted at $i$ hence we could build $k$ of them. In the following
		experiments though, we set $k=1$). This yields the shortest paths from
		$i$ to all $j \in \stcomp{X}$, and we denote the sum of the lengths of
		these $|\stcomp{X}|$ paths as $S_i$. Therefore a (non tight) lower
		bound of $f(T^*)$ is $\sum_{i\in X} S_i$. The last step is then to
		merge these $|X|$ BFT into a single spanning tree. Unfortunately I
		couldn't think of a straightforward way to do that. One method would be
		to count by how many BFT each edges is used, and use the opposite of
		these counts as weights for a minimum spanning tree algorithm, the
		intuition being that we want to preserve edges that are important for
		many nodes in $X$.

	\item[Expanding BFTs] The second is based on the observation that, if $X =
		\{i\}$ is made of a single node, then $T^* = T_i$. Thus if $|X| > 1$,
		we want to extend that property by expanding BFTs simultaneously from
		all $i \in X$. To ensure we get a spanning tree at the end, we need to
		avoid creating cycle. This can be done by maintaining information about
		the connectivity between nodes in $X$. It's motivated by the cycle
		example presented in \autoref{fig:cycle}~\vpageref{fig:cycle}. In that
		case, this method could obtain the optimal solution as the optimal edge
		will be among the last to be reached and thus cut.

		\begin{figure}[hbp]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{cpcycle.pdf}
			\caption{In a simple cycle, drawing a spanning tree $T_e$ amounts
				to cutting one edge $e$. Here $X$ is in orange and the label of
				each edge $e$ is the cost $f(T_e)$ of the associate tree.
				Although I didn't prove it, it makes sense that the
				optimal edge to cut is the one farther away from $X$. \label{fig:cycle}}
		\end{figure}

		In practice, we maintain a forest of tree rooted at each node of $X$.
		We expand them in a Breadth first manner while 
		\emph{\textbf{the following part is unclear; refer to
		\autoref{alg:mbfs} \vpageref{alg:mbfs} instead} More precisely, during the
		construction, each node in $V$ is assigned the index of $i \in X$ from
		which it has been discovered first. When two partial trees are about to
		join, we check whether their respective label are already connected or not.}

	\autoref{fig:cycle}~\vpageref{fig:cycle} also shows that between nodes 0
	and 17, the optimal edge is farther from 0, suggesting than larger subtrees
	(like the one starting at $0-1-2$) should grow faster. Taking into account
	the \textbf{Momentum} of each subtree, upon dequeuing a node, we skip it
	(i.e. enqueue it back) with probability based on the ratio of the size of
	the subtree this node belongs and the size of the currently largest
	subtree.

	\item[Modified SGT] Although BFTs enjoy alluring practical performances,
		they don't provide any theoretical guarantees. Therefore we might adapt
		\emph{Galaxy Tree} construction to that setting, by choosing star
		centers in priority in $X$. Practically, instead of sorting nodes by
		their degree, we sort them in lexicographical order according to $(1 -
		\mathbbm{1}_X, \textrm{degree})$ (that is we put all nodes of $X$
		first). When collapsing the graph, we need to decide how to propagate
		the information about membership to $X$. The simplest way (currently
		implemented in the experiments) is to say that a star (i.e. a node in
		the future collapsed graph) belongs to $X'$ (the successor of $X$ in
		the new graph) if its center belongs to $X$. A more complicated method
		would replace the binary indicator function by a real value
		representing the strength of the tie with $X$ (for instance, a star
		made only of nodes of $X$ should be more strongly associated to $X'$
		than one with only one node in $X$). It's unclear whether this would
		provide any gain.

\end{description}

In addition, we compare with some baselines that don't rely very much on $X$.

\begin{description}
	\item[BFT] A Breadth First tree rooted at (one of) the node with highest
		degree in $X$.
	\item[SGT] The good old short galaxy tree, completely ignoring $X$.
