\section*{Setting \& Notations}

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\inci{}$ be a \textbf{set}\footnote{thus not
containing any repetition} of \emph{forbidden edges}, where an edge is defined
as an (directed) pair of distinct natural numbers smaller than $n$, e.g.  $(1,
3)$. If a permutation $\sigma \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ of $n$ includes at least one
forbidden edge from \inci{}, we say $\sigma$ is forbidden by \inci{}.  For
instance, assuming $n=8$ and $\inci{} = \{(1,3), (4,6)\}$, $\sigma =
(8 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 6
\rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2)$ is forbidden because it includes $(4,6)$ and $(1, 3)$.

Our goal is to compute the number of permutations not forbidden by \inci{}: \[
f(\inci{}) = n! - \left|\{\sigma \in \mathfrak{S}_n; \sigma \; \text{is forbidden
by}\; \inci{}\}\right| \]

As a special case, let us denote $|S_0| = n!$, $|S_1| = f(\inci{})$ where
$|\inci{}| = n-1$ and more generally $|S_i| = f(\inci{})$ where $|\inci{}| =
i(n-1)$. The question is then how many times can we be told than $n-1$ edges do
not exist before $|S_i| \leq 1$.

\section*{Fun with Combinatorics!}

First, assume $\inci{} = \{(u,v)\}$. Let's build a forbidden permutation.
Because $v$ should always follows $u$, we can pretend they form a single node
and collapse them. Left with $n-1$ nodes, we can freely order them in one of
the $(n-1)!$ possible way and be guaranteed this will include $u \rightarrow
v$.

Now if $\inci{} = \{(u,v), (w,x)\}$, how many forbidden permutations are there?
Well $(n-1)!$ permutations include $(u,v)$, $(n-1)!$ include $(w, x)$ but we
are double counting those with both $(u,v)$ and $(w,x)$. By the same collapsing
argument applied to the two pairs of nodes, there are $(n-2)!$ permutations
include the two edges. Note furthermore that this still holds if the edges are
not node disjoint (e.g. $\inci{} = \{(u,v), (v,w)\}$).

Armed with the fact that there are $(n-i)$ permutations which include $i$
forbidden edges\footnote{when each node can only appear once at the head of an
edge}, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to compute $|S_1|$
\begin{align*}
	|S_1| & = n! - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{i+1} \binom{n-1}{i} (n-i)! \\
          & = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (-1)^i \frac{(n-1)!}{i!(n-1-i)!} (n-i)! \\
          & = (n-1)! \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (-1)^i \frac{(n-i)}{i!} \sim \frac{n!}{e}
\end{align*}

\bigskip

In $S_1$, each node has only one forbidden successor. In $S_2$ it has two.
However, some combinations counted by the binomial coefficients in the formula
cannot appear. For instance, while we are still double counting $[(0,1),
(1,2)]$, it makes not sense to subtract $[(0,1), (0,2)]$ as it is not feasible
in any permutation anyway. Therefore we need to replace the binomial
coefficients $\binom{|\inci{}|}{i}$ by $D_i$, which is the number of sequences
of $i$ edges from \inci{} such that each node appear at most once at the head
of an edge.

For instance, if $n=4$ and $\inci{} = \{(0,1),(0,2),(1,2),(2,3)\}$

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lll}
		\toprule
		$D_1 = 4$ & $D_2 = 4$                      & $D_3 = 1$             \\
		\midrule
		$[(0,1)]$   & $[(0,1),(1,2)], [(0,1),(2,3)]$ & $[(0,1),(1,2),(2,3)]$ \\
		$[(0,2)]$   & $[(0,2),(1,2)]$                &                       \\
		$[(1,2)]$   & $[(1,2),(2,3)]$                &                       \\
		$[(2,3)]$   &                                &                       \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}

More generally for $S_2$, denoting $|\inci{}|=2(n-1)=m$, $D_0 = 1$ (by
convention) $D_1 = m$ (as any single edge is admissible), $D_2 =
\frac{(m-1)(m-2)}{2}$, $D_3 = \frac{(m-2)(m-3)(m-4)}{6}$ and so on (although
I'm not sure exactly why). Empirically, $D_i = \binom{m+1-i}{i}$, even though
it gets a bit off as $i$ gets closer to $n-1$. Especially, $D_{n-1} = \lceil
\frac{n}{2} \rceil$. Still
\begin{align*}
	|S_2| & \approx \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (-1)^i \binom{2n-1-i}{i} (n-i)! \\
       & = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{(-1)^i}{i!} \underbrace{\frac{(2n-1-i)!(n-i)!}{(2(n-1)-i)!}}_{a_i} \\
\end{align*}

Removing the $-1$ of $a_i$ for clarity, we see that $a_0 = n!$ and $a_n =
n!$\footnote{even though it doesn't appear in the sum}, while the maximum is
reached at $i=\lceil \frac{2n}{3} \rceil$\footnote{Again no matter how
convinced I am it's true, that's a leap of faith}: let $n=3p$, \[
	a_i = \frac{(2\cdot3p - 2p)!(3p-2p)!}{2(3p-2p)!} =
	4p\cdots\underbrace{3p}_{n} \cdot 1 \cdots1 \cdot p\cdots 1
\]
